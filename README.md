This project was built using Selenium and Pillow packages.

There are several components into this project.

It started as a small program, where the program just saves a screenshot of the current calendar month of a given Mandarin propery but, this wasn't very helpful at all. 

What I was looking for is a way to get a screenshot of three calendar month based on MOStay availability. This will require the program to click thru the links to the next calendar.
